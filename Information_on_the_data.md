# The-effect-of-population-size-on-democracies
Essay in Democratic choice &amp; social welfare, spring semester 2022

Information on the data:

list_of_democracies.csv is based on the data from the economists democracy index 2021. 
I downloaded the pdf from https://www.eiu.com/n/campaigns/democracy-index-2021/ and loaded the table into excel. 
I used excel to clean the data and created a csv-file with all the countries considered “democratic” by this report.

size_of_parliament.csv is based on the data from a wikipedia-table. 
I loaded the data from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_legislatures_by_number_of_members directly into a excel table. 
I used excel to clean the data and created the csv-file with the population size and the number of MPs of all countries in this data set.
I am aware that this data is not really reliable. But it is in my opinion sufficient as the purpose was only show a general correlation.

The respective csv-files can be downloaded from the repository.
